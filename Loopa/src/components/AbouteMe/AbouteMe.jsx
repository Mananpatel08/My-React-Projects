      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Manan</strong>, the founder and developer of <strong>Loopa</strong> — a fresh, growing e-commerce platform focused on delivering a smooth, secure, and enjoyable online shopping experience.</p>

      <h2>How It All Started</h2>
      <p>As a developer passionate about solving real-world problems, I created Loopa to simplify online shopping. The idea was born from a desire to blend clean design, great performance, and product reliability into one platform. Every feature in Loopa was designed and developed from scratch — with the customer experience as my top priority.</p>

      <h2>What Loopa Offers</h2>
      <p>Loopa brings together a handpicked collection of quality products across various categories. Our platform is fast, mobile-friendly, and focused on user convenience. Whether you're shopping for fashion, essentials, or accessories, Loopa aims to make your journey effortless.</p>

      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>To build a trusted e-commerce space that values transparency, customer satisfaction, and quality service. I believe technology should serve people — not overwhelm them. Loopa reflects that philosophy through a simple yet powerful user experience.</p>

      <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
      <p>Loopa is just getting started. In the coming months, I'm working on adding more features — including personalized product suggestions, faster checkout, and enhanced security. Your support helps shape the future of this platform.</p>

      <p class="signature">— Manan, Founder of Loopa</p>
